###  Description 

The data were downloaded from https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/suppl/immunology/ITRAP_benchmark/
described in this paper [Benchmarking data-driven filtering for denoising of TCRpMHC single-cell data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-43048-3#data-availability)



raw_train.csv, ITRAP_train.csv are the datasets used to train the relative models. Here, the positive data points are derived from the above-described datasets. The negative data is generated by paring the positive TCRs to a peptide different from its target cognate (denoted as swapped negatives). The negative set is augmented by adding negative control TCRs from https://github.com/viragbioinfo/IMMREP_2022_TCRSpecificity. The data is randomly split into 5 partitions fot 5-fold cross-validation. Here, the list of epitopes is restricted to 4 (GILGFVFTL, GLCTLVAML, ELAGIGILTV, IVTDFSVIK);

vdj_eval.csv contains an evaluation set derived from VDJdb. Also here, the positive TCRs reger to 4 epitopes (GILGFVFTL, GLCTLVAML, ELAGIGILTV, IVTDFSVIK) and the negative data is generated by swapping positive TCR-peptide pairs and augmented by adding negative controls.

### training notes

To investigate performance inflation due to a similarity overlap between training and evaluation sets, a second evaluation was performed where TCRs from the evaluation data that had a kernel similarity value25 above 0.9 to the training TCRs were removed.
